Subject: [PATCH v4 0/3] Convert ppdev to y2038 safe

These series of patches try to convert parport device(ppdev) to
y2038 safe, and support y2038 safe and unsafe application at the
same time. The first two version is here[1][2][3].

An y2038 safe application/kernel use 64bit time_t(aka time64_t)
to avoid 32-bit time types broken in the year 2038. Given that
some time relative struct(e.g. timeval in ppdev.c) is mainly the
offset of the real time, the old 32bit time_t in such application
is safe. We need to handle the 32bit time_t and 64bit time_t
application at the same time. My approach here is handle them as
different ioctl command for different size of timeval.

Build successful on arm64, arm and x86_64 with C=1.

Changes since v3:
1.  Remove the useless compat ioctl in fs/compat_ioctl.c for
    parport device.

Changes since v2:
1.  Fix the wrong parameter in copy_to_user.

Changes since v1:
1.  Fix the warning when build against x86_64.
