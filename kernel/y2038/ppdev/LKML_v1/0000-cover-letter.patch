Subject: [PATCH 0/2] Convert ppdev to y2038 safe

These series of patches try to convert parport device(ppdev) to
y2038 safe, and support y2038 safe and unsafe application at the
same time. There were some discussions in y2038 mailing list[1].

An y2038 safe application/kernel use 64bit time_t(aka time64_t)
to avoid 32-bit time types broken in the year 2038. Given that
some time relative struct(e.g. timeval in ppdev.c) is mainly the
offset of the real time, the old 32bit time_t in such application
is safe. We need to handle the 32bit time_t and 64bit time_t
application at the same time. My approach here is handle them as
different ioctl command for different size of timeval.

Build successful on arm64 and arm.
