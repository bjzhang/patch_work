Subject: [PATCH v2 0/3] Add gpio test framework

These series of patches try to add support for testing of gpio
subsystem based on the proposal from Linus Walleij. The first version
is here[1].

The basic idea is implement a virtual gpio device(gpio-mockup) base
on gpiolib. Tester could test the gpiolib by manipulating gpio-mockup
device through sysfs or char device and check the result from debugfs.
Reference the following figure:

   sysfs/char device  debugfs
     |                   |
  gpiolib----------------/
     |
 gpio-mockup

Currently, this test script will use sysfs interface by default. I
plan set char device as default after it upstreamed.

In order to avoid conflict with other gpio exist in the system,
only dynamic allocation is tested by default. User could pass -f to
do full test.

Changes since v1:
1.  Change value of gpio to boolean.
2.  Only test dynamic allocation by default.
